# Homey MCP Server

Homey Pro App exposing an MCP server over HTTP, enabling AI assistants like Claude to control your smart home.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Install on Homey

```bash
git clone https://github.com/verdier/homey-mcp-server.git
cd homey-mcp-server
npm install
npm run install-homey
```

### 2. Get Your Authentication Token

You need a Homey Bearer Token for secure API access:

1. Login to [my.homey.app](https://my.homey.app)
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API Key**
3. Create a new API key with at least the `homey.app` scope

### 3. Configure Your AI Assistant

#### For Claude Desktop

> **Note:** Claude Desktop does not currently support HTTP-based MCP servers directly. We use `mcp-remote` as a bridge to connect to this HTTP server.

Add to your configuration file with your Bearer token:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "homey": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://YOUR_HOMEY_IP/api/app/com.verdier.mcp-server/mcp",
        "--allow-http",
        "--header",
        "Authorization:Bearer YOUR_HOMEY_TOKEN"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** After updating the configuration:

1. Completely quit and reopen Claude Desktop for changes to take effect.
2. **macOS users:** On first launch, you may be prompted to allow Claude Desktop to find and communicate with devices on your local network. You must allow this permission and then restart Claude for the connection to work.

#### For VS Code

Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "homey": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://YOUR_HOMEY_IP/api/app/com.verdier.mcp-server/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_HOMEY_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Replace `YOUR_HOMEY_IP` with your Homey's actual IP address and `YOUR_HOMEY_TOKEN` with your extracted Bearer token.

### 4. Start Using

Ask your AI: _"Turn on the living room lights"_ or _"What's the temperature in the bedroom?"_

## üìã Requirements

- **Homey Pro** with local network access (Homey Cloud not supported)
- **Node.js** 16+ and Homey CLI: `npm install -g homey`
- **Homey Bearer Token** for authentication

## üõ† Available Features

- **Device Control**: List, control, and query all Homey devices
- **Zone Management**: Filter devices by room/zone
- **Flow Automation**: List and view automation flow details
- **Natural Language**: Use conversational commands with AI assistants

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- **Flow Triggering**: The `trigger_flow` tool is currently not operational due to Homey API cross app limitations.

## üß™ Testing

Verify your installation with your Bearer token:

```bash
# Test MCP protocol
curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","id":1}' \
     "http://YOUR_HOMEY_IP/api/app/com.verdier.mcp-server/mcp"
```

## ü§ù Support

- Verify your Homey IP address is correct
- Ensure Homey Pro is on the same local network
